Machine Learning is getting a computer to solve a tractable problem for you. This is typically dealing with optimization problems- neural nets are just one flavor of this. 

There's also Bayesian opt, PDE Solving, etc. My plan for this repo is to find an interesting problem and code it up here as time goes by. 

Hopefully this repo doesn't turn into garbage. I plan to make a CLI-tool that visualizes the "solving" of different benchmark functions using some techniques we see here.

Otherise, you can treat this repository as working examples of various techniques I've learned over the years.
